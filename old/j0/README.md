# J0

The J0 library has ambitions of being a set of complete ES6 javascript functions to help build common JS applications (server side and client side).

In particular, a strong goal of this project is to allow consumers to pick and choose parts of the system as needed.  As such, this would mean that there are almost no dependencies on the project and there is no root-level distribution.  Instead, it is expected that callers just include inner parts of the system as needed.
